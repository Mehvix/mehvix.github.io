                    Anyone who has physical access to your Windows machine can
                    plug in and boot to a live USB drive which allows them to
                    see/edit/copy your entire filesystem â€” all images,
                    documents, applications, etc. â€” without logging in. All this
                    can be prevented by just encrypting your file system.
                </p>

                <h1>BitLocker</h1>
                <p>
                    Microsoft doesn't value your security. Their proprietary

                    is only available for paying Windows Pro and Enterprise
                    users (and even then, it isn't enabled by default ðŸ¤”). And,
                    if for some reason you're paying (extra) for Windows, you
                    still shouldn't use BitLocker. Microsoft practice

                        >there's a secret NSA key in Windows, whose functions we

                </p>

                <p>
                    The alternative to proprietary software is open source
                    software: anyone can verify an open source project's
                    legitimacy and contribute improvements of their own. For
                    Windows, the open source encryption software I'd recommend
                    is
                    <a href="https://veracrypt.fr/en/Home.html">VeraCrypt</a>.
                </p>

                <h1>VeraCrypt</h1>
                <p>
                    You can download the latest installer of VeraCrypt
                    <a href="https://veracrypt.fr/en/Downloads.html">here</a>.
                    Once you install it, the process of encrypting your drive(s)
                    is fairly trivial. For encrypting your storage device with
                    the operating system, you start by going selecting
                    <code>System</code> >
                    <code>Encrypt System Partition/Drive...</code> and following
                    the creation wizard. The default AES + SHA-512 is more than
                    enough. Once you get to "Collecting Random Data", shake your
                    mouse around â€” VeraCrypt gathers random data from your
                    mouse's position because (somewhat unintuitively)
                    <a
                        href="https://www.howtogeek.com/183051/htg-explains-how-computers-generate-random-numbers/"
                        >it's hard for computers to generate unpredictable
                        random numbers on their own</a
                    >.
                </p>

                <h2>Rescue Disk</h2>
                <p>
                    Later, when prompted to, I'd recommend that you create a
                    rescue disk â€” this is allows you to unlock your drive if one
                    day Windows can't boot or the VeraCrypt bootloader get
                    damaged (unlikely, but possible). All you have to do is grab
                    a USB drive, create a folder called <code>EFI</code>, and
                    add copy the generated Rescue Disk. If something ever does
                    go wrong and you want to decrypt your drive outside of
                    Windows, all you have to do is plug in and boot to the USB
                    then enter your decryption password. Because you still need
                    to have your password, you don't need to keep this USB
                    especially secure (but hey, it can't hurt!).
                </p>

                <h2>Wiping</h2>
                <p>
                    You'll also be able to optionally write wipe the drive of
                    all unencrypted data from the drive. Multiple passes is an
                    <a
                        href="http://www.infosecisland.com/blogview/16130-The-Urban-Legend-of-Multipass-Hard-Disk-Overwrite.html"
                        >urban legend</a
                    >
                    (doesn't improve security), wears the drives down, and can
                    take a very long time. One pass is sufficient and doesn't
                    take too long (compared to no passes).
                </p>
                <h2>Testing</h2>
                <p>
                    After selecting the number of passes, you should be prompted
                    to test that the boot loader works before VeraCrypt proceeds
                    with encryption and the wipe(s). Once you restart, you'll be
                    be prompted with the VeraCrypt boot loader before the
                    Windows login screen. Here, you enter your password (and pin
                    if you opted for one; if you didn't leave it empty). Once
                    you get back into Windows, VeraCrypt will open and prompt
                    you to actually encrypt your data and fulfill the wipe(s).
                    When that completes, you're done!
